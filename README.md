# FSEMate - Easily interact with "Fascicolo Sanitario Elettronico"

This Spring Boot application aims to simplify the interaction with the "Fascicolo Sanitario Elettronico", by providing a
REST API that hides the underlying SOAP messages the FSE makes use of.

The "Fascicolo Sanitario Elettronico" (FSE) is the first example of
an [Electronic Health Record (EHR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record) in Italy. Through it,
citizens can "trace and consult the entire history of their health care life, sharing it with healthcare professionals
to ensure a more effective and efficient service".
